#Design Your World

Natural language queries are simply not enough to narrow the choices down. In the spirit of an image is worth 1000 words, we use images to draw what is difficult to describe in words. Design items in your environment from scratch. 

This is the **Next-Generation** of shopping, helping you buy exactly what you need rather than scrolling endlessly.

### How It Works

1. Enter a text prompt to generate an image, upload your own starting image, or sketch an outline to start.
2. Make thematic changes or generative edits through natural language and inpainting.
3. Download images to make final touches in an editor of your choice.
